# :wrench: .files

_This is a **snapshot** my ([**@bookercodes**](https://twitter.com/bookercodes)) dot files.


I changed  the design, with [Base16-Builder](https://github.com/base16-builder/base16-builder). The lock script ist from [**reddit**](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/3358vu/i3lock_unixpornworthy_lock_screen/).
The Lock Logo I use is from [**Iconfinder**](https://www.iconfinder.com/icons/55827/lock_padlock_private_icon#size=256).
Something of the files are from the [**setupi3**](https://github.com/bookercodes/setupi3) Tutorial from [**@bookercodes**](https://twitter.com/bookercodes)
